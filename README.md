## Information

I set up different virtual and dedicated Server on a regular basis. Also, I'm getting asked quite often from friends, who ask me to help them set up and configure something on their machine. So I decided to write some - at least for me - useful bash scripts.

I am not a professional, so maybe there are better solutions for some tasks, but all of the scripts work for me and before I upload them, I tested them multiple times on different servers.

I am a huge Debian fan, so don't be surprised, most of my scripts are based on apt.

## Usage

If you want to download the whole collection, include the installer, just use the command below and follow the instructions, given in the shell output.

```
curl -Ssl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gxf0/lazy_server/master/get | bash
```

### Script Collection

For more information, please read the particular \*.md, which you can find in the [docs](https://github.com/gxf0/lazy_server/tree/master/docs) folder, or choose from the list at the top.
