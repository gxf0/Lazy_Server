## Information

I set up different virtual and dedicated Server on a regular basis. Also, I'm getting asked quite often from friends, who ask me to help them set up and configure something on their machine. So I decided to write some - at least for me - useful bash scripts.

I am not a professional, so maybe there are better solutions for some tasks, but all of the scripts work for me and before I upload them, I tested them multiple times on different servers.

I am a huge Debian fan, so don't be surprised, most of my scripts are based on apt.

### Script Collection
